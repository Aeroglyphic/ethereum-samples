# Ethereum

A collection of code examples from the ethereum ecosystem, in any shape or size

### evmhacks

Study behavior of `evm` directly from bytecode and assembly

### misc

* **minipow**, a simple pow hasher implementation
* **namehash**, a ens namehash cli command; compiled file way too big for its purpose, though.

### p2p

* **devp2p**, a thorough code example tutorial of ethereum's node stack, `devp2p` protocol and `pss` messaging protocol. This was previously in a separate repo named `go-ethereum-p2p-demo`.
* **protocol-complex**, an in-depth example of how to wrap a `devp2p` protocol to `pss` without changing the protocol code.

### solidity

* **escrow**, WIP generic escrow contract
* **upgrade**, example of upgradable contract

### swarm

* **mutable resources**, a recursive retriever of mutable resource updates. Also includes a `js` updater used in a presentation for Swarm Orange Summit 2018.
